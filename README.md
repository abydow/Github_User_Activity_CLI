## 🚀 Quick Start (For the Impatient)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+ 
- Internet connection 
- A GitHub username to research

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-activity.git
cd github-activity

# Make it executable (Unix/Linux/Mac)
chmod +x github-activity.py

# Run it!
python github-activity.py <username>
```

### Example Usage

```bash
python github-activity.py legend

python github-activity.py zane

python github-activity.py your-username
```



## 🎪 How It Works 

1. **You** type a username (the easy part)
2. **The script** politely asks GitHub's API for recent activity
3. **GitHub** responds with a JSON blob 
4. We parse that **JSON** fast
5. **Your terminal** displays beautiful, formatted activity


### Under the Hood 🔧

This project uses:
- `urllib.request` 
- `json` 
- `sys` 
- `datetime` 

**No pip install required!** This is 100% Python standard library. 

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage 

### Common Use Cases

**Scenario 1: The Job Interview Prep**
```bash
# Research the company's developers before your interview
python github-activity.py company-dev-username
```

**Scenario 2: Open Source Reconnaissance**
```bash
# See if a maintainer is active before opening an issue
python github-activity.py maintainer-username
```

**Scenario 3: Competitive Analysis**
```bash
# See what your competitors are building
python github-activity.py competitor-username
```

**Scenario 4: Pure Curiosity**
```bash
# What is DHH up to these days?
python github-activity.py dhh
```

### Pro Tips 💡

- GitHub API has rate limit (60 requests/hour without auth). Don't go crazy!
- The tool shows the 10 most recent activities by default
- Timestamps are in UTC 


## 🐛 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### "Error: User 'xxxx' not found"
Either you misspelled the username, or that user is so underground they don't exist yet. Double-check the spelling!

### "Error: API rate limit exceeded"
You've been clicking too much! GitHub limits unauthenticated requests to 60/hour. Take a coffee break ☕

### "Network Error: ..."
Your internet is down. Or GitHub is down. Or the internet is down. Check your connection!

### "This doesn't work on Windows!"
It does! But you might need to use `python` instead of `./github-activity.py`. Windows is special like that.
